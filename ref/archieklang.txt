Questions:
- What happens to samples that go off the end?
E.g. in Chord Gen there is a shift (offset) value - this can easily go off the end once Note 12 is included (sample index *2). ==> presume 0 sample byte.

- Looks like a small precision error with LoopGen vs C code?
  Trying to lerp but from 0x7fff to 0x0.
