Questions:
- What happens to samples that go off the end?
E.g. in Chord Gen there is a shift (offset) value - this can easily go off the end once Note 12 is included (sample index *2). ==> presume 0 sample byte.

- Looks like a small precision error with LoopGen vs C code?
  Trying to lerp but from 0x7fff to 0x0.

- Implement 16-bit linear to 8-bit log conversion.
- Smaller code implementation w/ parameterised fn calls rather than inline.

CloneReverse is bugged:
In AmigaKlangGUI the sample data is held in separate arrays.
In AmigaKlangGUI the loopgen code writes beyond the length of the sample by +2.
Clone Reverse reads one byte beyond the end of the cloned sample.
In AmigaKlangGUI this is fine as it contains the overrun sample data.
In runtime implementations this reads the first byte of the next sample.
Only solution for this would be to store the extra byte somewhere after doing loopgen.
Then special case reading this byte...
Or just ask Virgill why the AmigaKlangGUI has the +2 offset in loopgen.
And stop the clone reverse from reading over the end of the sample...

Other bugs:
The runtime implemation synth() function the loop runs one byte too far due to smp <= SmpLength[..]
This means an extra iteration of the noise generator per node per instrument.
Which makes the noise go out of sync with the AmigaKlangGui.
