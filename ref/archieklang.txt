Questions:
- What happens to samples that go off the end?
E.g. in Chord Gen there is a shift (offset) value - this can easily go off the end once Note 12 is included (sample index *2). ==> presume 0 sample byte.

- Looks like a small precision error with LoopGen vs C code?
  Trying to lerp but from 0x7fff to 0x0.


TODO:
- Implement remaining nodes
- Implement external samples
- Test all example MODs
- Implement 16-bit linear to 8-bit log conversion.
- Smaller code implementation w/ parameterised fn calls rather than inline.
- Tidy up documentation
- Replacement aklang2asm.bat for Archie
- Contact Virgill
